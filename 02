# This program calculates the factorial of a number

num = int(input("Enter a number: ")) # Get input from user for the number to find factorial

factorial = 1 # Set initial value of factorial to 1

for i in range(1, num + 1): # Loop through the numbers from 1 to the input number
    factorial *= i # Multiply factorial by each number in the loop

print("The factorial of", num, "is", factorial) # Print the result to the console
